Title: Multi-Group Poster for Facebook Admins

Description: Multi-Group Poster is a powerful and user-friendly web application built using Express.js, React, Redux, and TLK. 
It enables Facebook group administrators to efficiently manage and share content across multiple groups they own. 
By leveraging the Facebook API, this application allows you to create and post the same message 
to all of your Facebook groups with just a few clicks, streamlining your content management process.

Please note that due to Facebook API restrictions, this application can only post to groups where the user is an admin. 
This ensures a secure and controlled environment for sharing content within your own communities while maintaining compliance with Facebook's guidelines.
